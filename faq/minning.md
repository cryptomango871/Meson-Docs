## **What is the difference in the current testing period?**

All the Testnet Tokens will be mapped to 1% of the Mainnet Tokens. according to [FAQ-Token](https://docs.meson.network/faq/token), there will be 100,000,000 initial Meson Tokens, of which there will be 1,000,000 Tokens are used as the exchange of Testnet Tokens.

**Your Mainnet Tokens = \(Your Testnet Tokens / All Testnet Tokens\) \* \(1% \* All Mainnet Tokens\) = \(Your Testnet Tokens / All Testnet Tokens\) \* 1,000,000**

> **For example, let's assume there will be total 160,000,000 Testnet Tokens at last, and you have 2,000,000 Testnet Tokens that time, then you will get \(2,000,000 / 160,000,000\) \* 1,000,000 = 125,000 Mainnet Tokens.**
