## Common Attentions

### 1, How to **Change the Port**?

Please modify **config.txt at** the folder of Meson.

### 2, How to **Change the Space**?

Please modify **config.txt at** the folder of Meson.

### 3, Be sure to **Set up the Port Forwarding Rules**

This step is important for your own personal computer to run Meson.

It's much recommended to use Cloud Servers\(GCP, AWS, Azure, Alibaba, etc.\) which are easier and more stable. But if you still want to try to mine on your own PC at home with the network router... You could search ——

**"Port Forwarding" + \[Your Router Brand\]** at YouTube/Google/etc...

That is to change the configuration to tell your router this IP is connected with your PC so that Meson could find your device\(server\) through your router.
